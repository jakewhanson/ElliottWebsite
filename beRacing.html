       &emsp;Bill Elliott started out his racing career with the Winston Cup Series at Rockingham in 1976. Driving a No. 9 Ford Torino owned by his father, George, Elliott lasted 32 laps before his oil pump failed.
       He spent the next 5 years without a corporate sponsor, while the team, Elliott Racing, was owned by the Elliott family, which included Bill, his brothers Dan and Ernie, and their father, George Elliott.
       Five years may have sounded like a long time without a main sponsor, yet Elliott persisted. In the fall of 1980, Elliott received his first major sponsor from Harry Melling of Melling Racing.
       Melling Racing bought the team from George Elliott on December 1st, 1981. By 1983, Bill Elliott had one his first Winston Cup Race--the Winston Western 500--in the final race of the season.
       He finished second four times and gained a third-place finish in championship point standings in the same season. In 1984 Bill Elliott gained a full sponsorship from Coors, with earnings of $400,000.
       In ‘84 he won the Michigan 400, Miller High Life 500, and the American 500. Once again, Elliott finished third in championship points.<br />
       &emsp;Bill Elliott was only getting started. in 1985, he had 11 wins and 11 poles out of 28 races in the season. He also got the nickname, “Million Dollar Bill” because he was the first driver to win the Winston Million.
       Elliott soon became the second NASCAR driver to be featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated, following Cale Yarbourough. 1986 gave Elliott wins in both Michigan races, four poles and a fourth-place championship rating.
       In ‘87, he won his second Daytona 500, his first at the Talladega 500, received seven poles, and finished second in standings. 1987 was also the year Elliott set two records, as can be read on the
       <a href="../Bill Elliott Website/beAccomp.html" target="_blank">Accomplishments page</a>. Ernie, Bill’s brother, built the engine for the Ford Thunderbird that set those records. Finally, in 1988, Elliott won his first and only Winston Cup Championship, with six other wins and six poles.<br />
       &emsp;In 1992, Elliott left Melling Racing to join Junior Johnson & Associates to replace Geoff Bodine in the No. 11 Budweiser Ford. Elliott won five races in total, and had three poles. He finished second in standings.
       He went winless in 1993 and finished eighth in standings, and won only one race in 1994.<br />
       &emsp;After leaving Johnson’s team, Elliott made his own Winston Cup team from 1995 to 2000. called Elliott-Hardy Racing. The team soon became Bill Elliott Racing after Hardy stepped out in 1996. He became No. 95 and gained
       a corporate sponsorship with McDonald’s. Although Bill Elliott failed to win any races, he managed to get two top ten finishes in the championship standings, with an eighth place in both 1995 and 1997.<br />
       &emsp;Bill Elliott began driving for Dodge in 2000. He regained the No. 9 car he had years before. Elliott found success once again, as he won the pole for the 2001 Daytona 500 and got a top five win with fifth place.
       He finished the season with two poles, five top 5s, nine top 10 finishes, and one win at Homestead from the pole. In 2002, Elliott went to Victory Lane twice, winning at the Pennsylvania 500 and the Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
       His last win came in 2003 in Rockingham, the same place he drove his first ever Winston Cup race. He then announced he would be giving the No. 9 car to Kasey Khane and becoming a part-time R&D driver for Evernham, the team he was racing with in the 2003 season.<br />
       &emsp;Between 2003 and 2006, Elliott had little success, and even from 2007-2012, Elliott was not getting even top 10 spots like he used to. He quit racing after 2012, and is now focused on helping his son, Chase Elliott, with his racing career.

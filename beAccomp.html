      &emsp;Bill Elliott had quite a few major accomplishments in his 37 years of racing. His first major achievements were in 1985,
       where he won the Daytona 500, Southern 500 and Winston 500. In ‘86, Elliott won the Winston All Star race, and in 1987 he won 
      the Daytona 500 yet again. Finally, in 1988, Bill Elliott won the Winston Cup Series, a huge feat for such a new driver. He also
       won the Southern 500 that same season.<br />
      &emsp;Elliott also received quite the praise from NASCAR and NASCAR fans alike. He was named one of NASCAR’s 50 Greatest Drivers in 1998,
       and named the Winston Cup Series Most Popular Driver a record 16 times. He was inducted into the <a href="https://www.mshf.com/hall-of-fame/inductees/bill-elliott.html" target="_blank">Motorsports Hall of Fame of America
       in 2007</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nascarhall.com/inductees/meet-the-inductees/2015" target="_blank">NASCAR Hall of Fame in 2015</a>.<br />
      &emsp;The greatest accomplishments Bill Elliott has ever completed are the two records set by him in 1987. He set two NASCAR qualifying records
       in 1987; At Daytona, he had an average speed of 210.364 miles per hour, and at Talladega he broke his own record with an average speed of
       212.809 miles per hour. In both races, he used the Ford Thunderbird with the engine that his brother Ernie had built. Both records stand to this day,
       mainly because of Bobby Allison’s wreck that caused restrictor plates to be put in use by NASCAR, which no longer allow speeds that high. However, Elliott’s records are still extremely impressive.
